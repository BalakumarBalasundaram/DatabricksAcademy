# Introduction to Python for Data Science and Data Engineering
This course is intended for complete beginners to Python to provide the basics of programmatically interacting with data. The course begins with a basic introduction to programming expressions, variables, and data types. It then progresses into conditional and control statements followed by an introduction to methods and functions. You will learn the basics of data structures, classes, and various string and utility functions. Lastly, you will gain experience using the pandas library for data analysis and visualization as well as the fundamentals of cloud computing. Throughout the course, you will gain hands-on practice through lab exercises with additional resources to deepen your knowledge of programming after the class.
